# Changelog

The running record of what was built, when, by which tool, and why. This is
the shared handoff point between AI tools (Claude Code, Codex, Kilo Code, or
any other) and between sessions of the same tool — read it before assuming
context needs to be re-explained, and append to it before finishing any work
that changes committed code, running data, or infrastructure state.

Newest entries first. Each entry: date, who/what did it, what changed, why,
and any follow-up the next session should know about. Keep entries short —
this is an index into commits and docs, not a replacement for either.

## 2026-09-02 — Authorization matrix: close test and doc gaps (Claude Code)

Addressed `docs/AUDIT_2026-09-02.md` P1 #4 ("no documented+tested
authorization matrix"). The policy itself was already sound (every GraphQL
mutation uniformly `@require_admin`, matching `docs/AUTHORIZATION.md`), so
this was about closing the gaps between the policy and its documentation/test
coverage, plus one real inconsistency found while auditing REST:

- `docs/AUTHORIZATION.md` only listed 3 REST routes; the backend actually
  exposes ~15. Rewrote the REST table to cover `/api/search/*`,
  `/api/documents/*`, and `/api/dropbox/download`, and made explicit that
  `/health/{db,redis,ollama,qdrant,all}` are open with no auth at all outside
  `APP_ENV=production` (intentional per `_is_prod()` in `app/api/health.py`,
  but previously undocumented — a future reader could easily have mistaken it
  for a bug).
- Found `POST /api/search/index/crew/{crew_id}` was gated by
  `get_current_user_rest` (any authenticated user) despite writing to the
  Meilisearch index — a real inconsistency with every other write path, which
  are all admin-gated. Confirmed nothing calls it (frontend or backend) and
  tightened it to `require_admin_rest`.
- Only 2 of 14 admin-gated GraphQL mutations had a negative-authorization
  test. Added a parametrized test in `backend/tests/test_auth.py` covering
  the other 12, asserting a non-admin caller gets `FORBIDDEN` on each.
- Verified independently (not just trusting the prior commit's message):
  backend ruff format/check, mypy strict, and pytest (102 passed, up from 90)
  all green; single Alembic head.

**Follow-up for the next session:** `docs/AUTHORIZATION.md`'s own rationale
notes reads are deliberately open to any authenticated user (product needs
agents to browse all specialists), so resource-ownership scoping is out of
scope here by design, not an oversight — don't "fix" that without a product
decision. Separately, `backend/pyproject.toml` still fails `pip install -e .`
on a clean checkout (flat-layout package discovery error: `app/`, `data/`,
and `alembic/` are all top-level with no `[tool.setuptools]` package config)
— that's the exact command CI's backend job runs, and it predates this
session's changes. Not fixed here (out of scope for the auth-matrix slice);
worth its own small PR.

## 2026-09-02 — Real strict typing + anti-technical-debt rules (Claude Code)

User asked for strict rules to eradicate `any`/casts/technical debt going
forward, then correctly pushed back when an early pass introduced new `Any`
usage as a shortcut for untyped-looking third-party libraries. That pushback
changed the approach: don't just write policy, verify the enforcement
actually works, and don't accept `Any` without checking whether a real type
was available first.

**Tooling now actually enforces this (previously it didn't):**
- Backend: `mypy app` went from silently red (152+ errors under the exact
  CI command) to a fully strict, passing gate. Added
  `plugins = ["sqlalchemy.ext.mypy.plugin"]` (without it `Result.
  scalar_one_or_none()` etc. resolve to `Any` everywhere) plus
  `disallow_incomplete_defs`, `disallow_untyped_calls`, `check_untyped_defs`,
  `no_implicit_optional`, `warn_redundant_casts`, `warn_unused_ignores`,
  `strict_equality`, `enable_error_code = ["ignore-without-code"]`. CI's
  mypy step had `--no-strict-optional` silently weakening it — removed.
- Frontend: `tsconfig.json` had no `strict` at all — the entire React app
  had zero real type-checking on React itself, masked because
  `@types/react`/`@types/react-dom` were never installed and non-strict mode
  doesn't error on unresolvable-module-as-`any`. Installed both, enabled
  `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitReturns`,
  `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`. Added ESLint (`eslint.config.js`, flat
  config) — there was none before; `npm run lint` was only ever `tsc
  --noEmit`. `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` is a blocking error;
  `no-non-null-assertion` is a warning (visible, not blocking) so justified
  `!` stays reviewable instead of silently multiplying.
- Rules written into `AGENTS.md`, `backend/AGENTS.md`, `frontend/AGENTS.md`,
  and `docs/ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md` (new "Type safety" section): no
  `Any`/`any` without checking for real types first (most "untyped" libs
  here — meilisearch, qdrant_client, redis, sentry_sdk — actually ship
  `py.typed` and have real types; only celery doesn't), no cast/assertion
  without a comment stating the invariant, no bare `type: ignore`.

**Real bugs this surfaced (not just annotation gaps):**
- `backend/app/models/__init__.py`: every nullable date column (`date_of_birth`,
  `passport_expiry`, cert/work-history dates, etc. — 13 fields) was typed
  `Mapped[Optional[Date]]` using SQLAlchemy's `Date` *column-type class*
  instead of Python's `datetime.date`. Worked at runtime (the real SQL type
  comes from `mapped_column(Date)`), but poisoned static types on every read
  of these fields across mappers/schema/services. Root-cause fixed, not
  patched at each call site.
- `backend/app/services/crew.py::get_user_from_token`: reused the name
  `result` for both `verify_session_token()`'s tuple return and the later
  SQLAlchemy `Result` object — mypy (correctly) got confused, and so would a
  human reader. Renamed.
- `create_crew_member`/`update_crew_member` GraphQL mutations accepted
  `date_of_birth` as a raw string and relied on Pydantic's implicit
  coercion instead of parsing explicitly like `add_certification` already
  does — inconsistent with the codebase's own established pattern. Now
  parses with `date.fromisoformat`, matching precedent.
- `backend/app/services/sentry.py::filter_sensitive_data`: the PII-scrubbing
  callback (`before_send`, runs on every error sent to Sentry) indexed into
  `frame["vars"]`/`request["headers"]` without checking they were dicts —
  would `TypeError` and presumably break Sentry reporting entirely for any
  error where Sentry couldn't introspect a frame's locals. Guarded with
  `isinstance` checks.
- `frontend/src/types.ts` / `lib/mappers.ts`: `UserProfile` had no
  `nationality` field even though the mapper computed one from raw crew data
  and `SpecialistDossierPane.tsx` read `profile.nationality` in three places
  — the Nationality row in the specialist dossier's Personal Information
  section could never render. Added the field and wired it through.
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`: a `useCallback` deleting/deselecting the currently
  selected profile was missing `selectedProfileId` from its deps array —
  real stale-closure risk (the delete-selection logic could read outdated
  state). Fixed; two other flagged callbacks were just missing stable
  `useState` setters (harmless, added for lint cleanliness) — one of those
  additions initially caused a real TDZ error (`setQuery`/`setCommittedQuery`
  come from a hook called later in the component) and was reverted to a
  justified `eslint-disable` instead.
- `frontend/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`: `login(email, password, remember)` has
  always ignored `remember` — the backend `login` mutation has no
  session-duration parameter at all, so `LoginPage.tsx`'s "Remember me"
  checkbox currently does nothing. **Not fixed** — real remember-me needs a
  backend session-duration/storage design decision, out of scope for this
  pass. Made the no-op explicit in a comment instead of silently ignoring it.
- `backend/app/services/cv_processing.py`: `"GWO Wind"` was a duplicate dict
  key (copy-paste), silently shadowed by itself. Removed the duplicate.
- Several `response.json()` / external-API boundary reads (Ollama, Dropbox
  OAuth, Qdrant embeddings) returned `Any` into a typed function with no
  validation — added `isinstance` checks with safe fallbacks so malformed
  responses fail loudly/safely instead of propagating untyped garbage.

**Dead code removed** (found via `no-unused-vars` once ESLint existed):
`useSpecialistDocuments.ts`'s 165-line unused `DEFAULT_DOCUMENTS` mock
block, `graphql/validation.py::QueryValidationMiddleware` (unreferenced
anywhere), `auth/decorators.py::get_current_user`/`is_authenticated`
(unreferenced), ~15 files' worth of unused Lucide icon imports.

**Found but intentionally not fixed — flagged for a follow-up decision:**
- `backend`: `bandit -r app/` currently fails (exit 1) as CI runs it — 7
  pre-existing `B113 request_without_timeout` findings (`dropbox.py`,
  `dropbox_auth.py`, `upload.py` — directly violates this repo's own
  `AGENTS.md` timeout rule), 2 `B110 try/except/pass`, 1 `B105` false
  positive on a URL constant. None introduced this session; not fixed here.
- `backend/app/api/search.py`: `availability`/`classification`/`crew_id`
  query params are interpolated directly into a Meilisearch filter string
  via f-string with no escaping — a filter-syntax injection risk. Noticed
  while typing this file; fixing it is a security-hardening task, not a
  typing one.
- `frontend/components/DocumentVault.tsx`: has working `searchQuery`
  filter logic but no `<input>` wired to `setSearchQuery` — the vault search
  is inert. `FilterSidebar.tsx` similarly has an unused `toggleDepartment` +
  `ALL_DEPARTMENTS` — a department filter that's either half-built or
  should be deleted. Both left in place with a comment rather than guessed
  at.

**Verified before/after:** backend 90/90 tests, `mypy app`, `ruff check`,
`ruff format --check` all clean. Frontend 46/46 tests, `tsc --noEmit`,
`eslint .` (0 errors/15 justified warnings), production build, and
`ui:audit:strict` all clean.

## 2026-09-02 — Showcase readiness pass (Claude Code)

- Reviewed the repo end-to-end for showcase readiness. Confirmed the stack
  (11 containers) runs healthy, backend tests pass in ~5s with no hang,
  frontend typecheck/build/unit tests pass.
- Committed the large staged diff from the audit remediation pass below
  (commit `ff1329d`) — it had been sitting staged but uncommitted.
- Seeded demo data: ran `backend/seed_100.py` (9 → 109 crew members).
- Found and fixed a real gap: the seed script inserts directly into
  PostgreSQL and bypasses the app's normal create path, so Meilisearch only
  had 1 of 109 members indexed. Backfilled the index via a one-off script
  calling `ConsultantKnowledgeService.index_crew_member` for every existing
  row (109/109 indexed after).
- **Follow-up:** any future direct-DB seed/import script should either call
  the same indexing path itself or be paired with a reindex step — see
  `backend/app/services/consultant_knowledge.py::index_crew_member`.
- Set up this documentation system (this file, `CLAUDE.md` pointer files,
  stale-reference fixes) so future sessions/tools don't re-derive the above.

## 2026-09-02 — Monorepo merge, domain layer, CI hardening (Kilo Code)

Commit `ff1329d`. Executed the remediation plan in
`.kilo/plans/1788366627971-audit-remediation-plan.md` against the findings in
`docs/AUDIT_2026-09-02.md`. Highlights:

- Merged `frontend/` (previously a separate, gitignored repo) into this
  monorepo. See ADR 0001.
- Decoupled schema migrations from app startup: `alembic upgrade head` now
  runs as a Dockerfile entrypoint step; `database.py::init_db()` refuses to
  run against PostgreSQL at all (SQLite dev/test only). No more
  `create_all`-on-migration-failure fallback.
- Hardened CI: blocking mypy/ruff/bandit/pip-audit gates (mypy previously had
  `|| true`), deterministic installs, `requirements-dev.txt` split out so
  `aiosqlite` is actually present for tests.
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` now hardcodes `APP_ENV=production` on every
  service instead of relying on a default that could silently stay dev.
- Added `app/domain/` (fields.py, certifications.py) as a single owned
  vocabulary, and `ConsultantKnowledgeService` to centralize consultant
  retrieval/indexing that was previously scattered and inconsistent.
- Fixed test isolation so the suite no longer stalls on a live Redis check.
- Added `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`,
  `docs/AUTHORIZATION.md`, ADRs 0001–0003, `AGENTS.md` (root/backend/frontend).
- **Known still-open items** (see `docs/AUDIT_2026-09-02.md` for detail, some
  of which is now stale given the above): no documented+tested authorization
  matrix, Redis-backed controls still fail open in places despite ADR 0002
  choosing fail-closed, no outbox/idempotency for cross-system writes,
  `qdrant`/`ollama` images still pinned to `:latest`, several large files
  (`App.tsx`, `graphql/schema.py`, `SpecialistDossierPane.tsx`) not yet split.

## 2026-09-02 — Initial commits (Kilo Code / manual)

- `49b89d7` Initial commit: backend, infrastructure, and container stack —
  first working end-to-end `podman-compose up`, fixing several latent faults
  (missing `psycopg2-binary`, wrong Qdrant port, missing curl in backend
  image, `localhost`→`::1` healthcheck resolution, SELinux bind-mount label,
  a schema drift between `work_history` columns and the model/migrations).
- `4f413c7`, `f907a7d` — README fixes: service topology explanation, and
  correcting rebuild instructions to force-recreate containers after a build
  (compose does not recreate a container when only the image changed).
